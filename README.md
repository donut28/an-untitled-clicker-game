# an-untitled-clicker-game
One of my first Python Tkinter projects, featuring none other than ice-cream!

## Activity Information
I am no longer updating the game.
Thank you for all of your support and help, I do appreciate it.

## Downloading Information
The file name for any version of the game in the releases tab is `v0.0.release/patched.py` or `v0.0.release/patched.pyw`.

I'm working on converting the next release to a `.exe` file so it can be used on more devices.

**For Versions 1.3> or Version 3>**

To run the game, click on the downloaded game file. It should run provided you have Python 3.9 or later installed.

**For Versions <1.2 or Version 2 or earlier**

To run the game, you will need to launch Python 3.9 (IDLE) or later, then open the game file from within Python 3.9 (IDLE).
